New in version 0.9.2:
* THALASSA now outputs an additional log file in the output directory,
containing useful diagnostics for the current propagation.
* Fixed an issue in atsu.for that could cause a syntax error with newer gfortran
versions.

New in version 1.0:
* The solar flux can now be considered as time-varying by setting the new 'if107'
flag in input.txt. This affects the J77 and MSIS-00 atmospheric models.
* MSIS-00 now takes into account Earth flattening.
* A set of batch scripts for large-scale propagations have been added in batch/

New in version 1.1:
* The computation of the gravitational potential has been completely rewritten,
and it is now based on the Pines method. This is significantly faster than the 
previous method based on recursions for the Legendre associated functions and 
the trigonometric functions (which was also not very well optimized).
